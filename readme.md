# Architecture Patterns with Python

A study of the book **Architecture Patterns With Python** by *Harry Percival* and *Bob Gregory*. [link](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/architecture-patterns-with/9781492052197/)

###  Book description
As Python continues to grow in popularity, projects are becoming larger and more complex. Many Python developers are taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isnâ€™t always straightforward...

### Domain
A multi-region order allocator to batches of stock.

Four key design patterns:
 - The **Repository pattern**, an abstraction over the idea of persistent storage
 - The **Service layer pattern** clearly define where the use cases begin and end
 - The **Unit of work** to provide atomic operations
 - The **Aggregate pattern** to enforce the integrity of the data
